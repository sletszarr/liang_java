 *
 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations)
 * You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the fol- lowing 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
 *
 *      ax + by = e
 *      cx + dy = f
 *
 *          ed - bf         af - ec
 *      x = -------     y = -------
 *          ad - bc         ad - bc
 *
 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y :
 *      3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 *      2.1x + .55y = 5.9
 *
